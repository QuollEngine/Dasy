# Dasy

This is my experimental renderer that I am planning to be part of Quoll Engine. The reason it is a separate repository is to be able to quickly develop and iterate in isolation without the need for all the systems that exist in Quoll Engine.

## High level goals

The high level goals of the renderer are the following:

- GPU driven rendering
- Bindless design
- Forward+ renderer
- Fence-Based Resource Management
  - Frame independent render graph
- Order independent translucency
- Raytraced shadows
